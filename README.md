KuBERT-Central-Kurdish-BERT-Model
Introduction
The KuBERT-Central-Kurdish-BERT-Model leverages the powerful BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to address the computational linguistic challenges presented by Central Kurdish, a language with significant diversity and limited resources.

Overview
Where traditional embedding methods were limited, the implementation of BERT provides a novel means to better capture the complexities of the Kurdish language. The model's advanced embedding capabilities offer a means to understand the nuances and contexts that are inherently difficult for low-resource languages.

Methodology
The project involves the creation of a Kurdish text corpus, the development of a specialized tokenizer for Kurdish, and the application of advanced classifiers. BERT's integration into this framework aims to enhance language processing capabilities significantly.

Results
BERT's integration showcases a significant improvement over older methods. It has been proven to be more effective in accurately understanding and processing Kurdish, demonstrating its adaptability to languages with limited computational support.

Contributions
The project highlights the efficacy of BERT in enhancing computational linguistics for Kurdish, emphasizing the importance of adopting such models for other low-resource languages. It provides a benchmark for future work in the field of NLP for under-represented languages.

Training Details
The BERT model is intricately fine-tuned with a Kurdish-specific dataset, undergoing rigorous retraining and evaluation to ensure optimal performance across various configurations.
